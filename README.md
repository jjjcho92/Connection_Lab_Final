## Key concept(s) and/or intention(s) driving the project. Include any noteworthy inspirations or influences
- Growing up in Buddhist household, being familar with the swastika as a symbol of peace. Lived in the States for 10 years, understanding it's history but also connection with nowdays hate crimes in the West. 
- Seeing western tourists in Asia getting upset when they see swastikas, and asking Asian societies to action in cancelling the symbol.
- Trying to stay neutral while investigate the history and evolvment in societal trend of it (see presentation link).
- Inspired by Michael Warner's Public & Counterpublic writing, which we were assigned to read in Critical Experiences Class
- Also inspired by Hans Haacke’s “MoMA Poll” installation artwork in 1970


## Production decisions (i.e. technical, design, creative, etc.)
- I made a layout in Figma first this time, and based the design to it. It's not 100% percise since CSS drives me insane as always, but I'd say the overall design is much better than my first project (flags/ internet speed) in this class. 
-Decided to make it a simple poll with Yes/No question on purpose to reflect the binary style we make decisions in the greater society. 

## Major challenges and solutions
- Technical difficulty: Trying to figure out how to sort the data from the db took me forever. Also had trouble figuring out how to connect everything with Chart.js.
- The topic is senstiive in the West, and I have fear of either underdone or overdone it. I had to push myself to do under this climate (anti-Semitic news in our society).


## Lessons learned as well as potential next steps if work on the project continues
- Learned how db works (partner worked on the database part in my last proejct, so this is my first time actually working with database).
- Need to think through the logic and structure of your database first befor you start building. 
- Next steps: Right now it feels like an education tool only, with more interaction in the end of the poll might actually help people to "discuss" about this, hence actaully create a "new public"

## Any relevant references/resources
- many stackOverflow Q&As
- Unformately, I still ended up asking for help from the ex. If you see jQuery in the code, that's him helping me with troubleshooting. 
- For concept and topic reserach, I've included most references and resources on the last page of the project site.
